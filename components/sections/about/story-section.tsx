              for well-being, comfort, and peace of mind. Founded in 2015, Simply Maid set out to be
              more than just a cleaning service. We're here to make a difference in the lives of our
              clients, our cleaners, and our community.

              Our Story: From Vision to Reality
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Simply Maid began with a simple mission: to create a reliable, quality-driven cleaning
              service that clients could trust. The idea was born when our founder saw the need for
              better cleaning options on platforms like OzBargain, ProductReview, and Whirlpool.
              People were looking for trustworthy, efficient cleaners but found it difficult to find
              a service they could rely on.
            </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Since launching Simply Maid in 2015, we've grown to serve clients across Australia.
              Today, we're not only a top-rated service provider but a company that gives back to
              its community. Our journey has been fueled by challenges, including the impact of
              COVID-19. During that time, we stood by our cleaners, finding ways to keep going
              without layoffs, even when it meant personal sacrifices.
